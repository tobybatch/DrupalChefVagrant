LymebayDeploy 
=============

## Sub Modules

You must ```submodule init && submodule update```

## Quick start

 1. Change directory into this folder
 1. Copy/link your keys for git hub into the keys folder.  These will be installed onto the VM so don't use ones with passwords
 1. Run ```vagrant up```

This will create a vanilla fudge site in a VM. The drupal you created will be available on http://localhost:8808, the files for that site are in ./html/drupal
